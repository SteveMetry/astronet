      <h1>Hey Looks like you are Interested in Increasing your Lead Generation</h1>
      <h2>So what now?</h2>
      <p>
        Simple We hop on a <strong>15 min Demo Call</strong><br>where we can show you what working with us can give you</p>
      <h1>Are We going to try Pressure sell?</h1>
      <h3><strong>Absolutely NOT</strong></h3>
      <p>
        We don't even bring up the idea of onboarding until the second discovery call 
        where we discuss how to tailor our advertising to your brand culture.
        We Believe that with our industries we cant work with pressure sales. WE ARE NOT A PRODUCT TO BE BOUGHT
      </p>
      <h3><strong>We ARE A BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP</strong></h3>
      <p>
        we can only work out if we both are happy with each other and so we need to see if we are a
        good fit.
      </p>
      <h1>What Makes us Different?</h1>
      <p>
        Simply put We have every aspect of Advertising down to a T and do it all in-house
        We do the Advertising and 3D Floor-plan Design all in-house where as these skills on their own are usually comparable pricing (Usually $1,000 - 2,000 each) for a total of $2,000 - $4,000 We do both in house
        for the price of one
      </p>
      <h3><strong>WE GIVE DOUBLE THE VALUE FOR THE SAME PRICE</strong></h3>
      <p>
        not to sound cocky but if that offer of double the value for the same price was used in any other business, 
        the competitors of that business better resort to some magic to stay in the game
